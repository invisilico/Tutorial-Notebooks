## About Licensing

The project is unlicensed, and as such, I do not consent to reproduction of the notebook or it's use without my knowledge. 

It is available for all teachers that may want to use it for class, or any one really that wishes to play with it, so long as you follow the consent protocol mentioned in the link above. It involves sending a mail (to me, and me responding) or a github "issue" being raised (and for me to accept it). It helps me keep track of how many people used it, and collect feedback, so I may make imporvements or more notebooks in general.

If you have any ideas with the method, contact me! I'd love to hear them.
