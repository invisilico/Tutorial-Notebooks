## Tiny Message before you start

Hi, I'm really glad to see you here!

You might be here out of interest, or because your professor asked you to do this experiment. I'm hoping you enjoy it nonetheless. The experiment is a mash-up of some of the things I hoped to learn during my undergrad but had to go out of my way to learn, a lot of which was during the pandemic. I hope some of it is new and informative to you as well. Most of all I hope you enjoy looking at your own data and it'd be really cool if you find something interesting about yourself too.

If you do enjoy it, and find something cool, I'd be really glad if you shared it with me! (details below)

Importantly, if you are someone that's here out of interest and not because your professor asked you to, then please either raise an issue [here](https://github.com/invisilico/Tutorial-Notebooks/issues) or drop me an e-mail <a href="mailto:nishantjana5@gmail.com">here</a> with your name, a rough idea of who you are, an e-mail for contact, and what got you interested enough to try it out! Please do this **before** you do the experiment. It will help me track the reach of the notebook and allow you to official consent your usage of the notebook (it is unlicensed otherwise).

If you run into any issues, feel free to contact me!

## Intro

Okay, This experiment is a lot like the one commonly done with mice: studying activity-rest rhythms by recording movement of the wheel. Mice are nocturnal, and when they're awake at night in their cages (sad) they love to run, and they do that on their wheel. Of course, it's not the whole story: the mouse loves to eat and drink and laze around like we do, but wheel movement is a *sufficiently good* proxy for their activity. 

But this experiment isn't about a mouse, it's about **you**. So what might be a sufficiently good proxy for your sleep-wake or activity-rest rhythm?

I think the answer might just be, our *constant* usage of phones.

So that's the first step. Collecting your phone usage data. Something you can easily do following the steps I've documented [here](https://invisilico.github.io/Tutorial-Notebooks/Android-Takeout-HowTo).

This only works for android phones (sorry) so I would suggest you get the data from someone that uses an android phone, if you do not use one. If you're a part of a class and have your own data, consider sharing it with your friends. I would urge you to try sourcing your own data, but if you really **really** cannot arrange for it, don't worry, I'm sharing mine with you [here](). I trust you will be careful with it. (and share cool stuff about my data, with me!)

One more thing, since you're downloading the data for the experiment, I'd really appreciate if you took a lil extra time out to help me with it. I'm doing a project on human rhythms and your data could **really** help me understand a little more about *us* as a species. You can find more details on the main page [here](https://invisilico.github.io/Tutorial-Notebooks/).

## Onwards

Great! now that you have your data ready, we can head to the jupyter-notebook on google colaboratory. 

I know it might sound fancy and daunting to those of you that have never used it before, but trust me, as long as you keep clicking the play ("run cell") buttons on the left of each panel, you'll be good to go. For those of you interested, double click the panels to see the code doing the magic.

If you run into issues or think the code can be optimised, contact me!
I'm still an undergrad, I'd love to learn from you and with you.
