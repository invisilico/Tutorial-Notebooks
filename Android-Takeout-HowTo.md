### To obtain your Android app activity data:

Visit https://takeout.google.com/ and ensure you are signed into the same account as the primary one on your android phone. The process is quite straightforward but I've made sure to document each step in case you get lost! The page might look lengthy but you're really just a few clicks away.

The first step is to click on "deselect all" as shown below, since we only want to export the app activity data!
