# Tutorial-Notebooks

A jupyter-notebook based digital experiment notebook to help teach the basics of a neuro-behaviour experiment, completely ONLINE!

### For Teachers that would like to use this notebook to teach their class

### For Students that have been asked to do this experiment (or any interested individual)

Please read the page applicable (from the two options above) before using the notebooks.

This project started out thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, and hopefully, it will help teachers overcome one of the challenges they face while teaching online: not being able to give students experience from hands-on experiments. It surely will not be the same as actually doing a full length neuro-behaviour experiment, but I've tried to cover the basics, from cleaning, critiquing the data at hand, to understanding it's scope. To analysing underlying behaviour from the data (the concept of Markov Processes and HMMs) and making predictions from the data. All of this with a fair amount of plotting, and very little coding required from the student. 

I hope you all find it as interesting as I did, to analyse your own data, your own behaviour, and you own rhythms.


## Help us with your data!

Please consider sharing your android app activity data with us here[] along with a short questionnaire. (Or ask your students to do so). It's five minutes of your time and helps us greatly increase the power and generalizability of our research. All data is anonymised and we follow IRB approved protocols for existing data collection as detailed here. The project is in collaboration with the de la Iglesia lab at University of Washington, Seattle. Feel free to contact raysan53@uw.edu for any information regarding the same!


Please Note: 

The project is unlicensed, and as such, I do not consent to reproduction of the notebook or it's use without my knowledge. 

It is available for all teachers that may want to use it for class, or any one really that wishes to play with it, so long as you follow the consent protocol mentioned in the two links above. It involves sending a mail (to me, and me responding) or a github "issue" being raised (and for me to accept it). It helps me keep track of how many people liked it, and collext feedback, so I may make more notebooks/make this one better.
