# Sample Data Loader

Hi! I hope you're only here because you've exhausted all your other options and really really need sample data to work with.

I'd be happy to provide it with you, but you must do two things for me:

* Be careful with the data, don't download it or share it.
* Try guessing things about me from the data! 

Once you're done with the experiment, share what you learnt about me with me, and I'll tell you which guesses are right, and which guesses are not!
